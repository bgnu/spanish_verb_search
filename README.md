# Overview

This simple script allows the fast lookup of Spanish verbs and returns present, preterite, imperfect, conditional and future tenses for the indicative mood. It uses the [fred-jehle-spanish-verbs](https://github.com/ghidinelli/fred-jehle-spanish-verbs) database.

Currently it doesn't return the subjunctive or imperative moods, participles, and compound tenses.
